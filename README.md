## Abstract
Stall Card is a progressive web app created to solve the challenges of running a large-scale horse boarding barn. Horses have very individualized care needs. These needs often change with the horse's age, health, weather, etc. Barn's with many horses and multiple employees often struggle to keep everyone up to date with these changes, and to train new employees who aren't yet familiar with every animal. 

Stall Card addresses these challenges with an app designed for the barn manager. The user can add, edit, and delete a profile for each horse, which includes biographical details, feeding instructions, and important contacts.
